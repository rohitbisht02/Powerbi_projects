# Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard

## 1. Project Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze a large supply chain dataset to identify key trends and performance metrics. I used Power BI to clean, model, and visualize the data, creating a 3-page interactive dashboard designed for executive review and operational analysis.

## 2. Dashboard Pages

This dashboard consists of three distinct pages:

#### Executive Summary
A high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) including total sales, profit, order volume, and average delivery times. It also highlights the top markets and product categories.

#### Delivery Performance
A deep dive into the logistics, analyzing on-time vs. late delivery rates. This page identifies which shipping modes and departments are associated with the highest delivery risks.

#### Regional Sales & Profit
A geographic analysis of sales and profitability by country. This page uses interactive maps and slicers to explore regional performance and customer segments.

## 3. Key Insights & Findings
* **Data Incompleteness:** A key finding was that the dataset for 2018 is incomplete, containing only data for January. This explains the apparent "decline" in sales and must be accounted for in any year-over-year analysis.
* **Top Performers:** The Pacific Asia market and the Sporting Goods category are the primary drivers of sales and profit for the company.
* **Operational Risk:** The 'Standard Class' shipping mode is highly correlated with late deliveries, presenting a significant operational risk and potential for customer dissatisfaction.

## 4. Tools Used
